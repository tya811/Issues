the issue with graphics on the computer is that they do not reflect reality. Graphics on the computer need to move and the colors
need to be soft and fluxtuating as does the brightness of different parts of the screen. you need to simulate cloudy days, non cloudy days
and indeed time of day and night to achieve a superior feel to the computer.
